# Final Headless CMS App

In this assignment,
I used the **Advanced Custom Fields** and **ACF to Custom Database Tables** plugins
to create three new post types and database tables on my **Pantheon** hosted **Wordpress** site.
I used **SFTP** to update the **PHP** functions file,
creating custom **SQL** queries to return **JSON** formatted data from those tables at three unique **REST** endpoint urls.
This data is then displayed in a **Next.js** app,
written in **Javascript** and using **React** components,
which was then deployed to **Vercel**.
